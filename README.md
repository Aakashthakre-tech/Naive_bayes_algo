# Naive_bayes_algo
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes’ Theorem, assuming conditional independence between features. It is simple, fast, and highly effective for classification tasks, especially in text classification, spam detection, and sentiment analysis, even with large datasets.
